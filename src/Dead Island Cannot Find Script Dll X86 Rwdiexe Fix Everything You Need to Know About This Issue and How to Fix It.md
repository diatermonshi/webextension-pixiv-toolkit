Dead Island is a popular zombie survival game that was released in 2011. However, some players have encountered an error message that says "Cannot find script dll \_x86\_rwdi.exe" when trying to launch the game. This error prevents the game from running and can be very frustrating. Fortunately, there are some possible solutions that can help you fix this error and enjoy the game.
 
The error is caused by a missing or corrupted file called script\_x86\_rwdiexe.dll, which is a third-party script that is used by the game to activate the fix for engine\_x86\_rwdi.dll. This file is located in the game directory, usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dead Island or E:\Dead Island Riptide. If this file is missing or damaged, the game will not be able to find it and will display the error message.

There are several ways to fix this error, depending on the cause of the problem. Here are some of them:
 
- **Verify the integrity of game files**. This is a simple and effective method that can repair any missing or corrupted game files. To do this, you need to open Steam, go to your library, right-click on Dead Island, select Properties, go to Local Files tab, and click on Verify Integrity of Game Files. Steam will scan and fix any issues with your game files. This may take some time depending on the size of your game.
- **Reinstall the game**. If verifying the game files does not work, you may need to reinstall the game completely. This will ensure that you have a fresh and clean installation of the game without any errors. To do this, you need to uninstall the game from Steam or from Windows Add/Remove Programs, delete any remaining files and folders in your game directory, and then download and install the game again from Steam.
- **Run the installers from the Redist folder**. The Redist folder in your game directory contains some programs that are required for the game to run properly, such as DirectX, Microsoft Visual C++, and Net Framework. Sometimes, these programs may not be installed correctly or may be outdated, causing errors with the game. To fix this, you need to go to your game directory, open the Redist folder, and run all the installers that are there. This will update and repair any issues with these programs.
- **Rename the dll file to an exe file**. This is a workaround that some players have suggested and it may work for some cases. The idea is to rename the script\_x86\_rwdiexe.dll file to script\_x86\_rwdiexe.exe, which may trick the game into finding it. To do this, you need to go to your game directory, find the script\_x86\_rwdiexe.dll file, right-click on it, select Rename, and change its extension from .dll to .exe. Then try launching the game again.

Hopefully, one of these methods will help you fix the Dead Island Cannot Find Script Dll X86 Rwdiexe error and let you play the game without any problems. If none of them work, you may need to contact Steam support or Techland support for further assistance.
