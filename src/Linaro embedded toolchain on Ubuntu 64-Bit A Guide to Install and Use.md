# How to Install and Use Linaro Embedded Toolchain on Ubuntu 64-Bit
 
Linaro is a software engineering company that provides optimized tools and software for ARM-based devices. Linaro's embedded toolchain is a collection of cross-compilation tools that can be used to build applications and libraries for various embedded platforms, such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and Arduino.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install and use Linaro embedded toolchain on Ubuntu 64-bit operating system. We will also demonstrate how to compile a simple "Hello World" program for an ARM target using the toolchain.

## Step 1: Download the Toolchain
 
The first step is to download the latest version of Linaro embedded toolchain from the official website: [https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-7/arm-eabi/](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-7/arm-eabi/)
 
You can choose either the tar.xz or the tar.bz2 archive format. For this example, we will use the tar.xz format. The file name should look something like this: gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86\_64\_arm-eabi.tar.xz
 
Save the file to your preferred location, such as your home directory or the Downloads folder.
 
## Step 2: Extract the Toolchain
 
The next step is to extract the toolchain archive to a suitable location. You can use any graphical archive manager or the command line to do this. For this example, we will use the command line and extract the toolchain to /opt/linaro directory.
 
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the toolchain archive. Then run the following command:
 `sudo tar -xvf gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86_64_arm-eabi.tar.xz -C /opt/linaro` 
This will create a subdirectory named gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86\_64\_arm-eabi under /opt/linaro directory.

## Step 3: Add the Toolchain to the PATH
 
The final step is to add the toolchain binaries to your PATH environment variable so that you can access them from any terminal without typing the full path. You can do this by editing your .bashrc file in your home directory.
 
Open your .bashrc file with your favorite text editor and add the following line at the end:
 `export PATH=/opt/linaro/gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86_64_arm-eabi/bin:$PATH` 
Save and close the file. Then run the following command to apply the changes:
 `source ~/.bashrc` 
You can verify that the toolchain is added to your PATH by running:
 `which arm-eabi-gcc` 
This should output something like this:
 `/opt/linaro/gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86_64_arm-eabi/bin/arm-eabi-gcc` 
## Step 4: Compile a Hello World Program
 
To test if the toolchain works properly, we will compile a simple "Hello World" program for an ARM target using the toolchain.
 
Create a new file named hello.c in your home directory with the following content:
 `#include 

int main(void) 
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
` 
Then run the following command to compile it:
 `arm-eabi-gcc -static hello.c -o hello` 
This will produce an executable file named hello in your home directory.
 
## Step 5: Run the Hello World Program on an ARM Device
 
To run the hello program on an ARM device, you need to copy it to the device and execute it there. You can use any method to transfer files between your Ubuntu machine and your ARM device, such as USB, SSH, or SCP.
