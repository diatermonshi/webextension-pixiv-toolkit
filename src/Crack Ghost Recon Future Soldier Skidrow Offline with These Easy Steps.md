## Tips and Tricks for Playing Ghost Recon Future Soldier Offline
 
Here are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your offline gaming experience:

- If you want to play with other players offline, you can use the Guerrilla Mode. This is a co-op mode that supports up to four players on a single console or system link. You can choose from 50 waves of enemies across 10 maps and customize your weapons and gear. To access this mode, select Guerrilla from the main menu.[^2^]
- If you want to challenge yourself offline, you can try the Elite Mode. This is a difficulty level that makes the enemies more aggressive and accurate, reduces your health regeneration, disables your crosshair and mini-map, and limits your ammo supply. To access this mode, select Elite from the difficulty options when starting a new campaign.[^3^]
- If you want to unlock more weapons and attachments offline, you can use the Gunsmith Mode. This is a mode that allows you to customize your weapons with various parts and test them in a firing range. You can unlock new parts by completing challenges in the campaign or guerrilla mode. To access this mode, select Gunsmith from the main menu.[^4^]
